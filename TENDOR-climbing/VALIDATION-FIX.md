# Hip Tracking Validation Fix

## 🚨 **Problem Identified**
The console was showing:
```
[SkeletalRecorder] Recording quality: 0/90 valid frames (0.0%), 0 high confidence (0.0%)
```

**Root Cause**: The validation logic was **too restrictive** for AR body tracking scenarios.

## ❌ **Previous (Too Strict) Validation**
```csharp
// This was filtering out ALL valid AR positions!
bool isValidPosition = currentHipPosition.magnitude > 0.1f && 
                      Vector3.Distance(currentHipPosition, Camera.main.transform.position) > 0.3f;
```

### Issues:
1. **`magnitude > 0.1f`** - Too strict! AR positions like `(0.00, 0.02, 0.01)` failed this test
2. **`distance > 0.3f`** - Too restrictive for AR body tracking (people are often closer than 30cm)
3. **`Camera.main`** - Could be null in AR context, causing errors

## ✅ **New (AR-Appropriate) Validation**
```csharp
// More lenient validation for AR body tracking
// Filter out only obviously invalid positions (exactly zero or NaN/Infinity)
bool isValidPosition = !float.IsNaN(currentHipPosition.x) && 
                      !float.IsNaN(currentHipPosition.y) && 
                      !float.IsNaN(currentHipPosition.z) &&
                      !float.IsInfinity(currentHipPosition.x) && 
                      !float.IsInfinity(currentHipPosition.y) && 
                      !float.IsInfinity(currentHipPosition.z) &&
                      !(currentHipPosition == Vector3.zero); // Only filter out exact zero
```

### Improvements:
1. **Only filters truly invalid data**: NaN, Infinity, or exact (0,0,0)
2. **Accepts small positions**: `(0.00, 0.02, 0.01)` is now valid
3. **No camera dependency**: Removes `Camera.main` requirement
4. **AR-friendly**: Works with typical AR body tracking distances (0.5-3m)

## 🎯 **Expected Results**
Now you should see:
- ✅ Valid frames being recorded (likely 80-90% valid)
- ✅ Hip position data being captured properly  
- ✅ Red sphere visualization appearing during recording
- ✅ Successful character positioning during playback

The system will now properly record the small but valid hip movements that ARKit provides!
