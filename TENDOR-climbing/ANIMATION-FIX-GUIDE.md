# Animation Fix Guide for NewBody Character

## Problem Summary
The NewBody character is showing but not playing animations because:
1. The animator override controller is not properly configured
2. The animation from NewAnimationOnly.fbx is not being loaded correctly
3. The FBXCharacterController needs proper setup

## Quick Fix Steps

### Step 1: Add Animation Diagnostic Tool
1. In Unity, create an empty GameObject in your scene
2. Name it "AnimationDiagnostic"
3. Add the `AnimationDiagnostic` component to it
4. In the inspector, click "Quick Fix - Assign Override Controller"
5. Click "Run Full Diagnostic"

### Step 2: Manual Fix (if diagnostic doesn't work)

#### 2.1 Check Override Controller Setup
1. Navigate to `Assets/Scripts/Animation/Controllers/CharacterAnimationOverride.overrideController`
2. Make sure it has the correct clip assignments (should now be fixed)

#### 2.2 Assign Override Controller to FBXCharacterController
1. Find the FBXCharacterController in your scene
2. In the inspector, assign the `CharacterAnimationOverride` controller to the "Animator Override Controller" field

#### 2.3 Force Load Animation
1. In the FBXCharacterController inspector, click "Force Reload Animation from NewAnimationOnly.fbx"
2. Check the console for success messages

### Step 3: Verify Animation Setup

#### 3.1 Check Available Animations
1. In the FBXCharacterController inspector, click "List Available Animations"
2. Verify that animations are found in NewAnimationOnly.fbx

#### 3.2 Test Animation Playback
1. Click "Test Animation Playback" in the FBXCharacterController inspector
2. The character should start playing the animation

## Console Commands (Alternative)

You can also use these console commands in Unity's Console window:

```csharp
// List all available animations
FBXCharacterController.ListAvailableAnimations();

// Force reload animation from NewAnimationOnly.fbx
FBXCharacterController.ForceReloadAnimationFromNewAnimationFBX();

// Check animator status
FBXCharacterController.CheckAnimatorStatus();

// Make character visible for testing
FBXCharacterController.MakeCharacterVisible();
```

## What Was Fixed

1. **Override Controller**: Updated `CharacterAnimationOverride.overrideController` to properly reference the animation from NewAnimationOnly.fbx
2. **Auto-Detection**: Modified `FBXCharacterController` to automatically detect and load the first available animation from NewAnimationOnly.fbx
3. **Better Debugging**: Added comprehensive logging and diagnostic tools
4. **Animation Loading**: Improved the animation loading logic to handle different animation names

## Expected Result

After following these steps:
- The NewBody character should be visible in the scene
- The character should play the animation from NewAnimationOnly.fbx
- The animation should loop properly
- Hip tracking should work in sync with the animation

## Troubleshooting

If animations still don't work:

1. **Check Console**: Look for error messages in the Unity Console
2. **Verify FBX Import**: Make sure NewAnimationOnly.fbx has "Import Animation" enabled in import settings
3. **Check Avatar**: Ensure NewBody.fbx has a proper humanoid avatar configured
4. **Restart Unity**: Sometimes Unity needs a restart to properly reload FBX assets

## Files Modified

- `FBXCharacterController.cs` - Improved animation loading and debugging
- `CharacterAnimationOverride.overrideController` - Fixed clip assignments
- `AnimationDiagnostic.cs` - New diagnostic tool (created)
