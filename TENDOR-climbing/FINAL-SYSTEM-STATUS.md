### Fixed Component References:
- ✅ **BodyTrackingController** → All references properly connected
  - `imageTargetManager: {fileID: 242295901}` ✅
  - `recorder: {fileID: 242295900}` ✅  
  - `player: {fileID: 242295899}` ✅
- ✅ **BodyTrackingRecorder** → Character controller connected
  - `characterController: {fileID: 1865019753}` ✅
